# Explanation of the folder **'projects'**

The folder **'projects'** contains applications, which implement more real-world-relevant functionality.  
The idea is to create applications, which have both a real-world reference and necessitate the  
usage of different testing-functionality practiced (like basic pytest functionality, fixtures, mocking, etc.).
